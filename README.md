Library Management System - Class 12 CS Project

This repository contains my **Class 12 Computer Science half-yearly project**, a **library management system** in Python.

- The project demonstrates **Git branching and merging** by adding features one at a time.  
- I initially **removed some functions from `main.py`** and then **added them back using separate branches** to demonstrate branching workflow.  
- Each function is implemented in its **own branch** and merged into `main` gradually.
  

> Each function is tagged with a comment like `# added using branchX` to show the branching workflow.  
> The repository also includes a **striped/clean version of `main.py`** as a reference for branching.  
> Demonstrates **GitHub pull requests, conflict resolution, and commit history tracking**.
